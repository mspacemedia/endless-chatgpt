# Platformer Jump Game

This is a simple platformer game where the player can jump over obstacles to score points. The player can hold down the spacebar to control the height of the jump, with gravity pulling the player down once the maximum jump height is reached.

## Features

- **Smooth Jumping Mechanics**: The player can control the height of the jump by holding the spacebar, with a maximum jump height enforced.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The speed and size of obstacles increase as the player's score increases.
- **Responsive Design**: The game scales to fit the window size.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks the current score and the high score, which is stored in local storage.

## How to Play

- **Jump**: Press the `Spacebar` to jump. The longer you hold the spacebar, the higher the player will jump, up to a maximum height.
- **Avoid Obstacles**: Time your jumps to avoid hitting the green obstacles. If you hit an obstacle, it's game over.
- **Restart**: Press the `Spacebar` after a game over to restart the game.

## Game Controls

- `Spacebar`: Jump
